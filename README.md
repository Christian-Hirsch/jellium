# Quantum Coulomb gases
This package provides python scripts for simulation and visualization related to Boltzmann statistics for Coulomb gases

[Coulomb systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04095) are interacting particle systems $\{x_1, \ldots, x_N\}$

$$\sum_{i < j} g(x_i - x_j), $$

with $g$ denoting the [Green's function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_function) in the considered domain.
